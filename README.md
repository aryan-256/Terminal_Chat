# Terminal_Chat
A peer to peer encryted terminal chat.With help of python, the project builds encrytion based on the concept of RSA encryption algorithm's key generation i.e Public/Private key pair combination, JSON serialization for message encoding, and multithreading for concurrent message handling.

Features:

  RSA Encryption: Secure message exchange using public and private keys.  
  Prime Number Selection: Primes in the range [100, 1000] are used to generate RSA keys.  
  Real-time Chat: Simultaneous message sending and receiving via multithreading.  
  JSON Encoding: Encrypted messages are encoded in JSON for transmission
